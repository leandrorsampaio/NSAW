# Project Specification: Naval Strategy Game (Working Title)

## 1. Overview

A 2D, top-down, real-time naval strategy game for desktop platforms.

- **Inspiration:** The classic Japanese game "Naval South Pacific War" (NSPW), but adapted to be a real-time strategy (RTS) game rather than turn-based.
- **Core Concept:** The player commands a fleet of ships, navigates a large map, and engages in strategic combat against an opposing fleet.

## 2. Gameplay Mechanics

- **View:** Top-down 2D perspective.
- **Control:** Mouse-driven controls for fleet selection, issuing movement orders, and navigating the map.
- **Map:** A large, continuous world map that the player can scroll through by moving the mouse to the edges of the screen or by other UI means.
- **Combat:** Real-time battles between ships.

## 3. Aesthetic

- **Visuals:** Retro, low-resolution pixel art style, capturing the feel of older PC strategy games. High-fidelity graphics are not a primary goal.
- **Audio:** Simple, synthesized sound effects and music appropriate for the retro theme.

## 4. Technical Specifications

- **Platform:** Browser-based application, running locally.
- **Game Framework:** **Phaser.js**.
- **Language:** **TypeScript**.
- **Build Tool & Dev Server:** **Vite**.
- **Development IDE:** **Visual Studio Code** (or any preferred editor).
